- [x] in particular

- [x] A real "auto" mode.
- [x] Kill the server with a timeout.
- [x] Format: basic indents and blank lines, make display more compact.

- [x] Dictionary locations? -> \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ondict aka "~/.config/ondict"
- [x] Serve on a TCP connection and can query from a "real" remote server, rather than local UDS.
- [x] Serve the "offline mode" on a website, for better display, html format, single static pages (mime things)?

- [x] A guessing/fallback algorithm for words missing (especially for offline dicts)
- [x] Add an en-cn online/offline dictionary for quick enquiry -> oald9.

- [x] Appropriate module abstraction, and unit testing automation. (sources/decoder/renderer)
- [x] Lazy-loading for launch performance and memory usage?
- [x] Parse the MDD file, and serve the picture sources when working in HTML mode.
- [ ] A independent MDD parser command.
- [ ] See the TODOs in the code.
- [ ] Support multiple mdx libs at the same time and provide a user interface

---
The following are less important things that I want to finish.
- [ ] Editor plugin: give users the option to setup the server in advance, for better first-query user experience. 
- [ ] A system for reviewing, e.g. simple ANKI?
- [ ] Online mode: more information such as collocations/corpus/.....
- [ ] More search algorithms?(Refs: https://aclanthology.org/C10-1096.pdf)
- [ ] A more decent web page.
- [ ] Other online dict parsing engines if I have the motivation?
- [ ] A simple TUI using https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea ?
- [ ] Vim version
