- [x] in particular
- [x] consist verb table
- [x] Parse \<span class="PhrVbEntry"\>, e.g. consist. 
- [x] Space/indent in \<span class="heading span"\>, e.g."return"
- [x] Hyphen-connected for phrases (only for online mode), and "space separated" queries.
- [x] Take input from stdin.
- [x] Work as a server (to cache something).
- [x] Cache and save/restore stuff, in pure text.
- [x] A real "auto" mode.
- [x] Kill the server with a timeout.
- [x] Format: basic indents and blank lines, make display more compact.
- [x] Offline support? Not going to do that recently... I just use it myself.
- [x] Dictionary locations? -> \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ondict aka "~/.config/ondict"
- [x] Serve on a TCP connection and can query from a "real" remote server, rather than local UDS.
- [x] Serve the "offline mode" on a website, for better display, html format, single static pages (mime things)?
- [x] nested queries (the windows are overlapped now)
- [x] A guessing/fallback algorithm for words missing (especially for offline dicts)
- [x] Add an en-cn online/offline dictionary for quick enquiry -> oald9.
- [x] Bind an MDX with a potential CSS file for html mode, for display effects.
- [x] Use [`aho-corasick`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm) algorithm to perform a fuzzy search. 
- [x] BUG: QueryByURL will get an unexpected EOF error.
- [x] Automate the dict generating process, registering
- [x] Appropriate module abstraction, and unit testing automation. (sources/decoder/renderer)
- [x] Lazy-loading for launch performance and memory usage? -> ~~mdd has some panic, debug later~~ fixed
- [x] make Lazy-loading optional.
- [x] Parse the MDD file, and serve the picture sources when working in HTML mode.
- [x] Support multiple mdx libs at the same time and provide a user interface (no UI yet)
- [x] Integrated with FZF? or https://github.com/lithammer/fuzzysearch? https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Language-bindings#go?
- [x] `entry://` protocol and "auto"jump, such as `versatility` to `versatile` [node demo](./play.txt)
- [ ] `@@@LINK=norm` for some items, such as "tormentor/linker".
- [ ] "swung" why eudic can auto parse the "swing"?
- [x] fzf-mode: reduce the memory usage
- [x] Integrated with [mdcat](https://github.com/swsnr/mdcat)
- [x] Auto history. 
- [x] A better history/record system, to make the history.table less "polluted" by ongoing fzf-based queries. 
- [x] An independent parser cmd.
- [ ] See the TODOs in the code.
- [x] The progress bar while decoding?
- [ ] A sync-able history system, maybe "basicAuth" is needed.
- [ ] Automatically generate a valid configuration file, using template or Internet.
---
The following are less important things that I want to finish.
- [x] Editor plugin: give users the option to setup the server in advance, for better first-query user experience. 
- [x] A system for reviewing, e.g. simple ANKI? --> related to the history functionality?
- [ ] Online mode: more information such as collocations/corpus/.....
- [ ] More search algorithms?(Refs: https://aclanthology.org/C10-1096.pdf)
- [x] A more decent web page -> completed by Cursor
- [x] Other online dict parsing engines if I have the motivation? --> maybe "markdownify" is a workaround.
- [ ] A simple TUI using https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea ?
- [ ] Make the plugin compatible with Vim
